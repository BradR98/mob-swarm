# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-10-05_

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Current Phase** | Phase 2 core delivered (moving gates, red mobs, defeat); pending device testing |
| **Active Focus** | Validate Phase 1 `index.html` on real phones; begin Phase 2 lane flow |
| **Known Blockers** | None |

## Tech Stack Constraints

- Single self-contained `index.html` (HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS + embedded CSS)
- No npm dependencies, no frameworks, no external assets, no ads or trackers
- Portrait, mobile-first; 60 FPS target via `requestAnimationFrame`
- Zero per-frame allocation in hot paths (pooled mobs, typed arrays)
- Battery-conscious: capped DPR, pause when tab hidden

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Repo initialized, default branch `main`
- [x] Docs created (README, BACKLOG, CHANGELOG, PROJECT_STATUS)
- [x] `index.html` JS passes syntax check and headless logic test
- [ ] Manual test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Manual test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Sustained 60 FPS confirmed with 500+ active mobs
- [ ] Remote pushed to GitHub (requires valid `gh` auth)

## Handoff Notes

If model quota runs out, continue from the next unchecked item in [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md). Commit small and often.
