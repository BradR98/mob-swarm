## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cannon shield: 5 HP pips, red flash on hit; Defeat only at 0 HP (replaces instant defeat).
- Red waves funnel toward the blue cluster; red and blue masses attract laterally.
- 3-level progression (base HP 40/80/150, faster gates and spawns), level HUD, "Next Level" / "Victory - Play Again".
- Web Audio synthesized SFX (cannon pop, gate chime, collision click, hit thud, win/lose fanfares) and a mute toggle (persisted).
- Tests for shield, funneling, attraction, level progression.

### Changed
- Opponent base moved down 28px to make room for the HUD.

### Added
- Moving gates (sliding, bouncing, opposite directions) with rect-overlap trigger; no dead zones.
- Red enemy mobs (pool of 500) spawned from the opponent base, moving down at 0.75x blue speed.
- Blue-vs-red 1:1 cancellation using a zero-allocation spatial grid, with pop effects (pooled ring buffer).
- Defeat condition and "Try Again" overlay when red reaches the cannon line.
- Headless test suite (`node test/headless.js`).

### Changed
- `applyGate` parameter renamed to `mobIdx`; clones inherit parent gate bits.
- Debug hooks (`window.__mob`) only exposed at `index.html#debug`.
